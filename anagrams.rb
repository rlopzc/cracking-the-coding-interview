words = %w(The Words With FriendsÂ® Cheat from YourDictionary is the perfect help
you need. Enter your tiles to find a list of words. Our word finder scans the
dictionary to deliver complete word lists sorted by word length and base points
 so you can easily find the highest scoring word. Read more at Any single
 non-alpha-numeric character can be used as the delimiter, %[including these],
 %?or these?, %~or even these things~. By using this notation, the usual string
 delimiters " and ' can appear in the string unescaped, but of course the new
 delimiter you've chosen does need to be escaped. However, if you use
 %(parentheses), %[square brackets], %{curly brackets} or %<pointy brackets>
 as delimiters then those same delimiters can appear unescaped in the string
 as long as they are in balanced pairs: natics, quick results can be sorted
 either by length or by score all while learning the definitions when clicking
on the word. If you happen to be a Scrabble Superhuman, like our Mr.

solver. If you're a Scrabble Starter and are just entering the world, or war,
